/**
 * @title SignatureBouncer
 * @author PhABC and Shrugs
 * @dev Bouncer allows users to submit a signature as a permission to do an action.
 * @dev If the signature is from one of the authorized bouncer addresses, the signature
 * @dev is valid. The owner of the contract adds/removes bouncers.
 * @dev Bouncer addresses can be individual servers signing grants or different
 * @dev users within a decentralized club that have permission to invite other members.
 * @dev This technique is useful for whitelists and airdrops; instead of putting all
 * @dev valid addresses on-chain, simply sign a grant of the form
 * @dev keccak256(`:contractAddress` + `:granteeAddress`) using a valid bouncer address.
 * @dev Then restrict access to your crowdsale/whitelist/airdrop using the
 * @dev `onlyValidSignature` modifier (or implement your own using isValidSignature).
 * @dev See the tests Bouncer.test.js for specific usage examples.
