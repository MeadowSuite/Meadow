SHORT DESCRIPTION

LONG DESCRIPTION
	The Meadow.Cli is an interactive commandline for the Meadow project.  It provides a test server to deploy solidity contracts to so that you can interact with their functions directly.
	
NOTE
	The help files will be updated as frequently as possible to make sure that all changes and as many use cases as possible are referenced here.
	
TROUBLESHOOTING NOTE
	Meadow.Cli can be installed as both a dotnet global tool or as a powershell module.  
	Both contain the same files and functionality, so don't worry about missing out on any important features.  
	Once you have installed Meadow.Cli, please remember to use the same method you used to install it to update it.  
	If you installed as a dotnet global tool, powershell package management does not know you have it installed and won't be able to update it.  
	The same goes for installing as a PowerShell Module, if you try to update it with the dotnet command nothing will happen.  
	It is 100% possible to have both installation methods on the same machine, they will be separated by their installation directory.  
	If you do use both installation methods to install Meadow.Cli, please use both methods to keep the installs up to date.
